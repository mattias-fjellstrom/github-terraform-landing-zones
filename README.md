# GitHub-Terraform Landing Zones

This repository contains an implementation of the Terraform landing zone on GitHub discussed in my blog post at [mattias.engineer](https://mattias.engineer/).

The blog post discuss the setup when the target provider is Azure, the code for this example is found in the [azure](/terraform/azure/) directory. A similar setup for AWS can be found in the [aws](/terraform/aws/) directory.
